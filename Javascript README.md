Learn the basics of Javascript through example scripts

The approach I am going to take here is one of a complete tear down of the scripts so you get an
understanding of how each line works and why they do what they do.<br>

When I first learned Javascript I was fairly intimidated by the fact that it was in esscence a 
completely new language that created a completely new way to have a conversation between a human and a web browser.<br>

In many ways it is like learning a new spoken language. You need to learn the nouns and the verbs and how they are used and what each one means. Then you need to make sure that when they are all combined into a sentence they translate appropriately into a logical discussion.<b>

The way I approached my learning was to break down each line and dive into what was meant by the line and how it interacted with other lines in the script. This worked for me and allowed me to get up to speed in a fairly quick fashion.<br>

I have supplied abare bones HTML template for your use so you can get started focusing on Javascript and not setting up the HTML file.
Even though this is something you should be very familiar with as you proceed down  your development path.<br>
