	<h2>Understanding an if "Conditional" statement</h2>    
    	<p>
   Conditional statements in Javascript<br>
are statements that require a true or <br>false answer. Meaning it is either a true  statement or not true.
    	</p>

	<p>In this example we are going to <br> create a javascript that sets a variable "amount" to the number "500"<br> then we will set the condition to determine if the variable is true or not.<br>
We do this by setting the condition to another value in this case we will set it up to readâ€¦"if amount is less than 1000
<br> then we will call the alert like this<br>
"alert(it's less than 1000!)" .
<br><br>Read the script between the script tags below to see how this is setup. Then open this page in a browser to see what happens.
<p>

	<ul>
		<li>An H1 Tag</li>
		<li>Two paragraphs</li>
		<li>An unordered list</li>
	</ul>
	//This is where your inline javascript lives
	
	<script>
		var amount = 500;
		if ( amount < 1000)
		{
		alert("it's less than 1000!");
		}
	</script>
	//no more javascript after this
